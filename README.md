# Calculator App - CodSoft Task 3

In this project, I created a simple calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The Calculator App project provides a user-friendly interface for performing mathematical calculations with ease. It features a responsive design and intuitive layout, making it accessible and functional across both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is designed to showcase fundamental web development skills, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing interactive features. The calculator includes standard arithmetic operations, a clear button to reset inputs, and a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal usability.
